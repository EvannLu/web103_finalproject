## About / Description and Purpose

The Lexington Link is a full-stack web application designed exclusively for Hunter College students to combat social isolation and foster a more connected campus community.

The app serves as a focused friend and hangout matching platform, moving beyond superficial connections by matching users based on shared academic courses, compatible majors, and preferred local hangout spots.

The primary purpose is to provide students with the tools to easily:
* Discover and connect with peers who share interests or classes.
* Form and manage casual hangout groups for socializing, studying, or exploring the city.
* Schedule and communicate plans within a safe, university-verified environment.

By implementing essential features like school email verification, a familiar swipe interface, and robust Group Formation and Chat Functionality, The Lexington Link aims to directly address the high rates of student loneliness by making healthy, local social connection simple and intuitive.


### Inspiration

* Majority of Hunter College students are anti-social, so this build to bridge connections and create a more healthy environment for college lifestyle. 
* Dating Apps: swipe feature allows an easy experience for users. 
* "More broadly, loneliness is a significant issue among college students in the U.S., with a survey indicating nearly two-thirds (64.7%) of college students report feeling lonely. This data highlights the mental health impact of loneliness, including psychological distress."  - ActiveMinds (Nonprofit organization)
