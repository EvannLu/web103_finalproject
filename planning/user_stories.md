3. As a Student, I want to see profiles of potential hangout buddies so that I can quickly decide whether to connect with them using the swipe feature.
4. As a Student, I want to filter potential buddies by their courses and preferred hangout time so that I only see people who are relevant to my current needs.

6. As a Group Organizer, I want to send invitations to other students so that they can join my scheduled hangout group.
